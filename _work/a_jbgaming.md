JB Gaming is a small video game development studio based out of Omaha, NE.  I was tasked to make a company website and to make it simple and cheap as possible.  After considering a few options I ended up building the site with Jekyll.  Jekyll ended up being perfect for the job.  Jekyll is a static website generator so I was only serving html, css, and javascript to the server.  No database or CMS involved, because of this I was able to host the site on an AWS S3 bucket for much cheaper than renting an EC2 server from AWS.
